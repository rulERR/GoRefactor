1) think about STB realization (singleton is ok??)
2) typeSwitch variable search - now it is marked by Obj.Kind == -1. think over
3) get rid of sym.Obj.Name gets. replace with sym.Name()
4) rename IsStructPointer to smth better
5) think of adding a BasicTypeSymbol
6) GetOrAddPointer last lines ???
7) public/private !!!
8) SymbolTableBuilder:
	a mode is needed?
	b IsGoFile to another file ??
	c build types - magic isn't needed, typechecker instead.
	d make little methods for buildSymbolTable

9) improve build and clean scripts

features:
	- speedUp symbol search by setting ST position range (valuable for local ST's)
