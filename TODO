+ 1) think about STB realization (singleton is ok??)
			OK

+ 4) rename IsStructPointer to smth better
			GetBaseStruct
+ 5) think of adding a BasicTypeSymbol
			Added
+ 6) GetOrAddPointer last lines ???
			no such fucn now (see parseStarExpr)
+ 9) improve build and clean scripts

7) public/private !!!
8) SymbolTableBuilder:
?	a mode is needed?
?	b IsGoFile to another file ??
+	c build types - magic isn't needed, typechecker instead.
+	d make little methods for buildSymbolTable

? 2) typeSwitch variable search - now it is marked by Obj.Kind == -1. think over
? 3) get rid of sym.Obj.Name gets. replace with sym.Name()


features:
	- speedUp symbol search by setting ST position range (valuable for local ST's)
